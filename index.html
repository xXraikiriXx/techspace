    <h1>The glorious story of Resinhardt</h1>
    <p>
      During the Omnic Crisis, Reinhardt was stationed at Eichenwalde alongside
      his mentor General Balderich von Adler, leader of the Crusaders. Balderich
      was chosen to join the strike force that would become Overwatch, and was
      given a medal in the shape of the organization's logo with its name etched
      on the back, indicative of his selection. The night before he was set to
      leave and join his new team he and Reinhardt spent time together at
      Braueret Mittagskrug where Reinhardt balked at the idea of vanishing into
      a secret organization instead of staying in Eichenwalde, serving as a
      Crusader, and the glory that came with it. Before master and pupil could
      further debate the issue any further, Eichenwalde came under direct attack
      by omnic forces, and the two shook hands reciting the Crusader's oath
      before entering the fray.[10] Young and reckless, Reinhardt disobeyed
      orders to stay with his unit in favor of charging headlong into battle on
      his own determined to destroy as many omnics as he could in the name of
      glory. Though he destroyed every Bastion unit unfortunate enough to cross
      paths with him Balderich caught up to him and angrily ordered him back to
      his unit which was, unknown to the two, under extremely heavy fire.
      Insistent that they were not only fine but simply slowing him down
      Reinhardt continued to carve a path through the omnic forces until a
      then-unknown OR14 unit dropped onto the field. Thrilled with the idea of a
      new foe Reinhardt rocketed towards the new adversary only for his opponent
      to stop his charge and slash Reinhardt's left eye with its heat blade.
      Ordering their forces to fall back, Balderich was forced to intervene to
      save his defenseless student. Though he succeeded, Balderich's shield
      emitter was destroyed and he was mortally wounded by the OR14's heat
      blade. With the German forces in full retreat the pair fell back to the
      great hall of Eichenwalde castle.[10] Barricading the door, Balderich
      ordered Reinhardt back to the rally point with the rest of the Crusaders.
      Cheerfully insistent on fighting his way back with Balderich it wasn't
      until his master removed his helmet and insisted that he was staying did
      Reinhardt notice the gravity of Balderich's wound. Distraught, Reinhardt
      tried to reason with Balderich only for him to remind Reinhardt of his
      Crusader's oath and demanded that he keep it as he extended his hand.
      Unable to simply leave Balderich to die Reinhardt still refused. Instead
      of ordering him away, Balderich gently reminded him that the team needed
      him to be their shield, which at last caused Reinhardt to relent and he
      took his master's hand one final time. When their grip broke Reinhardt
      found Balderich's Overwatch acceptance medal in his hand. Exchanging the
      Crusader's oath one final time Reinhardt left Balderich his hammer and
      left him to his fate.[10] Reinhardt successfully rejoined his unit,
      shielding them with his body when his barrier gave out. The German forces
      ultimately pushed the omnics back enough to give the rest of the armed
      forces time to counterattack, but Eichenwalde and Balderich were lost and
      with the exception of Reinhardt himself no other crusaders escaped the
      battle alive. Balderich's death changed Reinhardt and his mentor's
      sacrifice would weigh on him for decades after the fact, but until then
      Overwatch awaited.[10]
